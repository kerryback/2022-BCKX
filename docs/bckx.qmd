## Model Overview

- Correlated firms, may or may not be informed
- Voluntary truthful disclosure
- Risk-averse investors
- Dynamic timing game

## Literature

- Static model with single firm
  - Unraveling argument: Grossman 1981, Milgrom 1981
  - Plausible deniability: Dye 1985, Jung-Kwon 1988 
  - Risk aversion: Dye-Hughes 2018

- Dynamic model with single firm
  - Exogenous announcement $\Rightarrow$ disclosure option: Acharya-DeMarzo-Kremer 2011

## Clustering of announcements

- Acharya-Demarzo-Kremer: "Endogenous Information Flows and the Clustering of Announcements"
- Can there be clustering following voluntary disclosures?
  - Voluntary disclosures are always good news for disclosing firms
  - Are they always good news for positively correlated nondisclosing firms?
    - Yes for nonstrategic (uninformed) firms
    - No for strategic (possibly informed) firms

## Lyft and Uber

<br>
WSJ May 2021: 

<br>
Lyftâ€™s commentary was so bad, Uber Technologies moved up its earnings release and conference call after watching its own shares trade off sharply in sympathy.

## Risk premia

- Dye & Hughes 2018 show that nondisclosure is variance increasing when investors are risk averse.
- We show that nondisclosure increases risk premia.
- Nondisclosure produces right skewness.  Distribution is a mixture of
    - truncated normal conditional on being informed and not disclosing
    - normal conditional on not being informed

## Voluntary disclosures

- If known to be informed, equilibrium is to disclose (Grossman/Milgrom)
- If some possibility of being uninformed, equilibrium is threshold strategy: good types disclose and bad types do not (Dye, 1985)
- Risk premia (Dye-Hughes, 2018)
  - stati
- American option (Acharya-DeMarzo-Kremer, 2011): 
  - signal correlated with later public signal
  - provides incentive to keep disclosure option alive
