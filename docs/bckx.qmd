## Overview

- Voluntary truthful disclosure
- Correlated firms become informed at random times
- Risk-averse investors
- Main results:
  - Dynamics of risk premia
  - Clustering of disclosures
  - Comparative statics
  - Some empirics

## Example 

. . .

Wall Street Journal
(May 4, 2022):

. . .

<br>

Lyft's commentary was so bad, Uber Technologies moved up its earnings
release and conference call after watching its own shares trade off sharply in sympathy.

<br>

- Apparently, Uber cares about its short-term share price
- Might have delayed its earnings announcement had Lyft reported exceptionally good results

## Literature

- Static model with single firm
  - Unraveling argument: Grossman 1981, Milgrom 1981
  - Plausible deniability: Dye 1985, Jung-Kwon 1988 
  - Risk aversion: Dye-Hughes 2018

- Dynamic model with single firm
  - Disclosure option: Acharya-DeMarzo-Kremer 2011

## Disclosure option

- Out of the money when price is above true value
- At the money when price = true value
- Value to keeping option alive: another firm may disclose a high value, increasing prices of correlated firms
- Only optimal to exercise when sufficiently far in the money
- Need to find equilibrium exercise boundary

## Risk premia

- Nondisclosure is information and should reduce risk
- But nondisclosure creates skewness
- We show that nondisclosure increases risk premia
  - Risk premia rise before disclosures,
  - drop upon disclosures, 
  - and begin rising again.
- Complements Dye-Hughes who show that nondisclosure is variance increasing

## Clustering of announcements
  
- Good news delays disclosures  
- But any news reduces option values $\rightarrow$ accelerates disclosures
- Voluntary disclosures are good news for positively correlated nondisclosing firms
- But the option effect dominates for disclosures that are only moderately good news
- Complements ADK, who show that negative exogenous announcements accelerate disclosures

## Model

- Firms get signals $\tilde x_i$ at independent uniformly distributed random times in [0,1].
- Signal = value
- No other randomness
- Signals are symmetric correlated joint normal
- Risk-free rate = 0

#

- Representative investor with CARA utility
- Signals (values) are joint normal with market wealth
- Use risk-neutral pricing
  - $\mu, \sigma, \rho$ are physical parameters
  - $\mu^*, \sigma, \rho$ are risk-neutral parameters
  - $\mu^* = \mu -$ beta $\times$ risk aversion $\times$ variance

## Firm's objective 

- Utility = integral of share price over [0,1]
- Share price is random, depending on other firms' disclosures
- Assume firms maximize risk-neutral expectation (use market's SDF).


## Some sample paths with two firms

. . .

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](figures/paths.png)
:::
::: {.column width="30%"}

- Red dots are disclosures
- Disclose at $t$ if
  - get signal at $t$ above bdy
  - get signal before $t$ and bdy at $t=$ signal

## Some sample paths with two firms

:::: {.columns}

- For last firm, bdy = price

![](figures/paths.png)
:::

- High first disclosure $\Rightarrow$ later second disclosure
- Vertical dotted line on left is extreme clustering
:::
::::

## Single firm prior to disclosure

- Always, $\text{price} = E^*[\text{signal} | \text{nondisclosure}]$

. . .

$$
\{\text{nondisclosure}\} = \{\text{received signal} < \text{price}\} \\ \cup \{\text{didn't receive signal yet}\}$$

- Standard result (Dye-Hughes): $P_t = \mu^* + \sigma z$ where 

. . .

$$ z = - \frac{t\phi(z)}{1 - t + t\Phi(z)}$$


## Last of two firms

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](figures/onepath.png)
:::
::: {.column width="30%"}
- Nondisclosure event at $t=0.45$ depends on bdy at $t=0.3$
- Complicates fixed point condition somewhat
:::
::::

## Later: same as one firm

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](figures/onepathb.png)
:::
::: {.column width="30%"}
- Nondisclosure event at $t=0.7$ depends on bdy at $t=0.7$
- Same fixed point condition as for one firm
:::
::::

## Equilibrium price as function of boundary

- Always, $\text{price} = E^*[\text{signal} | \text{nondisclosure}]$
- Nondisclosure event depends on boundary (and prior disclosures)
- Can in principle solve $\text{price} = f(t, \text{boundary}, \text{prior disclosures})$

## Analysis of option with $>$ 1 firm

- Consider firm at $t$ that knows value $x$
- Value function is $\quad \max E^* \int_t^1 P_u\,d u$
- Value function $= J(t, x, \text{prior disclosures})$
- $d J = J_t \, dt + E^*[\Delta J]$
- $E^*[\Delta J] = \left\{E^*[J \mid \text{jump}] -J \right\}\times \text{arrival rate} \times dt$
- HJB equation is $P_t + J_t  + \left\{E^*[J \mid \text{jump}] -J\right\}\times \text{arrival rate} = 0$


#

- jumps occur when moving from $i$ firms remaining to $i-1$
- can take value with $i-1$ remaining as given and solve for value with $i$ remaining
- HJB equation is linear ODE for $J$
- value matching is $J(t, x, \cdots) = (1-t)x$ when $x=$ bdy
- smooth pasting is $J_x(t, x, \cdots) = 1-t$ when $x=$ bdy

## Marginal condition

- HJB, value matching, & smooth pasting $\Leftrightarrow$

. . .

$$ x-P = \left\{E^*[J \mid \text{jump}] - (1-t)x\right\} \\ \times \text{arrival rate}$$

for $x=$ bdy.

- Given $P = f(t, x, \text{prior disclosures})$, can in principle solve for $x$

## Clustering

- Assume two firms and neither has disclosed at $t$
- Firm 2 has value $x$ at conjectured boundary
- Which disclosures by firm 1 at $t$ contribute to $E^*[J \mid \text{jump}] - (1-t)x$?
- Disclosures at the boundary do not.  They cause the boundary to fall rather than rise (Proposition 4.2).
- $\Rightarrow$ only need to calculate arrival rate of info arrival and disclosure at $t$

## Disclosure at the boundary $\Rightarrow$ boundary falls

## Risk premia

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](figures/paths-riskpremia.png)
:::
::: {.column width="30%"}
- same low and high first disclosures as before
- bottom row is $E[\tilde x | \cdots] - P$ divided by $P$
:::
::::

## Some comparative statics 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](figures/PricesBdys.png)
:::
::: {.column width="30%"}
- Most interesting parameter is correlation
- Higher correlation $\Rightarrow$ faster fall of price & bdy
:::
::::

## Do 1st or 2nd announcers have higher returns?
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](figures/returns_by_correlation.png)
:::
::: {.column width="30%"}
- low correlation $\Rightarrow$ 2nd announcer has higher avg return
- high correlation $\Rightarrow$ opposite
:::
::::

## Earnings announcements

- Expected announcement date from Wall Street Horizons
- Actual minus expected is increasing in peer and aggregate announcement returns
  - Returns in 3-day window preceding firm's announcement or expected announcement date
  - Returns = FF 3-factor excess returns
- Robust to several definitions of peers (industries) and using past year's date as expected date
- Stronger for announcements in last half of earnings cycle

## Conclusion

- Delayed announcements $\Rightarrow$ falling prices and higher risk premia
- Voluntary disclosures are good news but can accelerate other disclosures due to drop in option value
- Empirics suggest firms do time their announcements based on peer returns (like Uber)
- Correlation effect on 1st/2nd announcer returns may be worth exploring
