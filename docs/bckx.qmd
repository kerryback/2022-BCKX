## Overview

- Voluntary truthful disclosure
- Correlated firms become informed at random times
- Risk-averse investors
- Main results:
  - Dynamics of risk premia
  - Clustering of disclosures
  - Comparative statics
  - Some empirics

## Example 

. . .

Wall Street Journal
(May 4, 2022):

. . .

<br>

Lyft's commentary was so bad, Uber Technologies moved up its earnings
release and conference call after watching its own shares trade off sharply in sympathy.

<br>

- Apparently, Uber cares about its short-term share price
- Might have delayed its earnings announcement had Lyft reported exceptionally good results

## Literature

- Static model with single firm
  - Unraveling argument: Grossman 1981, Milgrom 1981
  - Plausible deniability: Dye 1985, Jung-Kwon 1988 
  - Risk aversion: Dye-Hughes 2018

- Dynamic model with single firm
  - Disclosure option: Acharya-DeMarzo-Kremer 2011

## Disclosure option

- Out of the money when price is above true value
- At the money when price = true value
- Value to keeping option alive: another firm may disclose a high value, increasing prices of correlated firms
- Only optimal to exercise when sufficiently far in the money
- Need to find equilibrium exercise boundary

## Risk premia

- Nondisclosure is information and should reduce risk
- But nondisclosure creates skewness
- We show that nondisclosure increases risk premia
  - Risk premia rise before disclosures,
  - drop upon disclosures, 
  - and begin rising again.
- Complements Dye-Hughes who show that nondisclosure is variance increasing

## Clustering of announcements
  
- Good news delays disclosures  
- But any news reduces option values $\rightarrow$ accelerates disclosures
- Voluntary disclosures are good news for positively correlated nondisclosing firms
- But the option effect dominates for disclosures that are only moderately good news
- Complements ADK, who show that negative exogenous announcements accelerate disclosures

## Model

- Firms get signals at independent uniformly distributed random times in [0,1].
- Signal = value
- No other randomness
- Signals are symmetric correlated joint normal
- Risk-free rate = 0

#

- Representative investor with CARA utility
- Signals (values) are joint normal with market wealth
- Use risk-neutral pricing
  - $\mu, \sigma, \rho$ are physical parameters
  - $\mu^*, \sigma, \rho$ are risk-neutral parameters
  - $\mu^* = \mu - $ beta $\times$ risk aversion $\times$ variance

## Firm's objective function

- Utility = integral of share price over [0,1]
- Share price is random, depending on other firms' disclosures
- Assume firms maximize risk-neutral expectation (use market's SDF).


## Some sample paths with two firms

. . .

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=70}
![](figures/paths.png)
:::
::: {.column width=40}

- Red dots are disclosures
- For any $t$, disclose at $t$ if
  - get signal at $t$ and it is high (above bdy)
  - or had signal before and bdy finally fell to signal

## Some sample paths with two firms

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=70}
![](figures/paths.png)
:::
::: {.column width=40}
- With two firms alive, boundary>price (option must be sufficiently far in the money ...)
- For last firm, boundary=price

- Price jumps with high disclosure $\Rightarrow$ second disclosure is later
- Vertical dotted line on left is extreme clustering = possibility of immediate second disclosure

## Single firm prior to disclosure

. . .

$$\text{price} = E^*[\text{signal} | \text{nondisclosure}]$$

. . .

$$
\{\text{nondisclosure}\} = \{\text{received signal} < \text{price}\} \\ \cup \{\text{didn't receive signal yet}\}$$
